<h1 align="Center">Using the Raspberry Pi as a Network Gateway for 
USB Test and Measurement Equipment</h1>
<h4 align="Center">Volker Ziemann, 9-AUG-2014</h4>



I while ago I bought a small Rigol oscilloscope for my home electronics
projects. The little device sports a USB host port through which it connects to
a computer. When I naively connected it to my Linux PC it was immediately
recognized as a usbtmc device, which I could see when checking the systems log
file. There was also an auto-magically generated device file <tt>/dev/usbtmc0</tt>
in the usual device file subdirectory. Cool, I thought, let's figure out how to
talk to my scope.
<p>
Some archaeology on the web revealed 
<a href="http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5989-6718EN.pdf">
application note AN1465-30</a> from Agilent, describing the protocol and
giving sample C-code of how to talk to usbtmc devices. A while ago I implemented
that in a small program that sends <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPIB">GPIB</a> 
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Commands_for_Programmable_Instruments">
SCPI</a> commands via the above mentioned device file. This worked quite nicely from my 
Linux host PC. The program I discuss below is a close descendent. 
</p><p>
Later, at work we bought a more up-scale oscilloscope that is equipped with an Ethernet 
port, that allows to use the same GPIB and SCPI commands, but sending them via Ethernet .
I wanted the same functionality for my inexpensive oscilloscope and employ a Raspberry 
Pi as a gateway from Ethernet to USB. So, here we go and work out, how to do just that
using mostly shell scripts and some standard programs. 

</p><h3>Kernel matters</h3>

To start with, I flashed a SD card with the most recent Raspbian image (dated June 20, kernel 3.12)
and then plugged in the scope. Checking the log revealed that the scope was identified,
but the usbtmc kernel module was not loaded which a check with <tt>lsmod</tt> showed.
In fact the kernel module was missing from the default image. So, I needed to compile 
the usbtmc.ko kernel module by hand. This approach was also discussed in this
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=66&amp;t=60784&amp;p=469648">Raspberry 
Pi forum entry</a> and is fairly straightforward using the instructions from the 
<a href="https://github.com/notro/rpi-source/wiki">Raspberry Pi kernel sources</a>
web-page. I followed the instructions on that page, downloaded the rpi-source
program, upgraded the compiler and copied the running kernel's .config to the root of
the linux kernel tree (/home/pi/linux if you ran rpi-source from the home directory).
Examples of how to build kernel modules are given on 
<a href="https://github.com/notro/rpi-source/wiki/Examples-on-how-to-build-various-modules">
this page.</a> I tested with the "Hello World" example from that page, which succeeded
on the first try. 
<p> 
Now I needed to locate the source code for the usbtmc kernel module. Fortunately it was 
present in the kernel tree and I found it using <tt>find . -name usmtmc.c</tt> in 
/home/pi/linux which reported back <tt>./drivers/usb/class/usbtmc.c</tt>. I copied the 
usbtmc.c source file to a separate directory under the pi home directory called 
/home/pi/usbtmc, generated a Makefile containing the line 
</p><pre>        obj-m := usbtmc.o
</pre>
in it and executed the command
<pre>        make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$(pwd) modules
</pre>
as described on the page with the
<a href="https://github.com/notro/rpi-source/wiki/Examples-on-how-to-build-various-modules#hello-world-example">
Hello World example.</a> This generated the <tt>usbtmc.ko</tt> module, which I loaded with
<pre>        sudo insmod usbtmc.ko
</pre> 
I verified that it is loaded with <tt>lsmod</tt> and when connecting the oscilloscope by USB the
/dev/usbtmc0 device file shows up in the /dev subdirectory. In order to make sure that the module 
is loaded every time the system boots, I put the command <tt>insmod /home/pi/usbtmc/usbtmc.ko</tt> 
into the system startup file /etc/rc.local. For convenience I put the source and compiled kernel 
module into the archive that accompanies this project. Note, however, that the module only works 
for the kernel it is compiled for.
<p>
The permissions and ownership of the device file restrict its use to the root user. This means
that using it requires preceeding commands with sudo. A somewhat more convenient solution
is to change the permissions by creating a udev rule by creating a file called 98-usmtmc.rules
with the single line
</p><pre>       KERNEL=="usbtmc[0-9]*", GROUP="gpio", MODE="0660"
</pre>
and copying it to the /etc/udev/rules.d/ subdirectory. This assigns the group "gpio" to
the devices with names that start with "usbtmc" and sets the permissions in a way that anyone 
who belongs to that group can use it. User "pi" is already a member in the default system.
<p>
Ideally, everything in this section should be taken care of by the Raspberry kernel maintainers
and including the usbtmc functionality by simply selecting it when compiling the kernel and the
modules. I hope this will happen in the future.
</p><p>
Once the kernel module is loaded, we can use it in a rudimentary fashion by using the shell's
<tt>echo</tt> command for writing and <tt>cat</tt> for reading, thus this line
</p><pre>       echo "*IDN?" &gt; /dev/usbtmc0 ; cat &lt; /dev/usbtmc0
</pre>
reads the ID string from the oscilloscope, in my case
<pre>      Rigol Technologies,DS1052E,DS1EDxxxxxxxxx,00.02.05.02.00
</pre>
The command string "*IDN?" is an old standard GPIB command most devices accept and report some 
string with their description. An ugly side effect of using <tt>cat</tt> is that the <tt>cat</tt> 
commands times out because it uses the <tt>fread</tt> function call as is explained in 
<a href="http://www.home.agilent.com/upload/cmc_upload/All/usbtmc.htm">this document.</a> 
But that can be easily remedied...

<h3>Software</h3>

...by writing user-space software to talk to the oscilloscope over USB. I started writing 
a bash shell script that mimics the above line, but unfortunately the "-u" option is not 
supported (any more) by the standard <tt>cat</tt> command. I therefore wrote a small C-program 
that mimics the <tt>cat -u</tt> command, but uses unbuffered read and write. The relevant 
code snippet is reproduced here
<pre>      while (is=read(0,buf,buflen)) {  // 0=stdin
        if (is!=buflen) {buf[is]='\n'; is++;} // add newline at end
        write(1,buf,is);            // 1=stdout
        if (is!=buflen) break;
      }
</pre>
It basically copies stuff from standard input to output in chunks of <tt>buflen</tt> bytes. If 
fewer bytes arrive, the copy process terminates. I called this program <tt>cat2</tt> and the 
source code is in the archive accompanying this article. Compile it with <tt>gcc cat2.c -o cat2</tt>. 
Note that I had to increase the variable <tt>buflen</tt> to larger than the maximum data chunk
that can be expected and that is a bit more than a megabyte for the small scope I own. This is
due to a <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-usb@vger.kernel.org/msg20328.html">quirk in
the Rigol firmware.</a> Increasing the buffer to 2 megabyte was a simple solution, but you
might have to adapt the line <tt>const int buflen 2000000</tt> near the top of the <tt>cat2.c</tt>
source file if you own a different scope. From what I understand, this only affects Rigol scopes.
<p>
Note also, that I add a newline character at the end of the transmission, which makes the output
a little nicer to look at. Just remove the second line in the above code snippet if you dislike
this.
</p><p>
I then used this program in a bash script file I called <tt>talk2scope.sh</tt>, reproduced here
</p><pre>      #!/bin/bash
      if [ -z $1 ]; then DEV=/dev/usbtmc0 ; else DEV=$1 ; fi
      while read line; do
         if [ -e ${DEV} ] ; then
            sleep 0.01
            echo $line &gt; ${DEV}
            if [[ $line == *\?* ]] ; then
               sleep 0.01
	       /home/pi/usbtmc/cat2 &lt; ${DEV}
            fi
         else
            echo "Device ${DEV} does not exist"
         fi
      done
</pre>
This program reads one line at a time from standard input and pipes that to the usbtmc 
device file. If there is a question mark in the scpi command, it reads from the device
and pipes the output to standard output. The sleep commands are needed to give the oscilloscope
some time to think between commands if they are passed in fast sequence. This bash script is 
invoked by either of the following two ways
<pre>      echo "*IDN?" | ./talk2scope.sh
      ./talk2scope.sh &lt; commands.scpi
</pre>
where <tt>commands.scpi</tt> is a text file with one SCPI command per line. 
<p>
A word on timing: when testing the program I noticed that transferring a megabyte waveform 
while the scope is connected to my desktop PC takes about 7.5 seconds. Doing the same local
transfer on the Raspberry Pi takes about 56 seconds. When transferring shorter waveforms 
with a few hundred data points, a performance hit is not noticeable.
</p><p>
Thus, we can write to and read from the scope on the Raspberry Pi, though the network 
functionality is still missing. But that's next. 

</p><h3>Networking</h3>

For networking we simply use the <tt>netcat</tt> or <tt>nc</tt> program, the Swiss army knife 
of the networking population in order to extend standard input and output across the network.
Just make sure you have the traditional netcat tool installed which provides the -c and -e command 
line options. If it is missing, install it with
<pre>      sudo apt-get install netcat-traditional
</pre>
which makes the binary <tt>nc.traditional</tt> available. That's the one we use and the server 
application becomes a one-liner
<pre>      nc.traditional -l -p 8000 -c /home/pi/usbtmc/talk2scope.sh
</pre>
whence netcat opens a network socket on port 8000 (-p 8000) and listens (-l option) there. 
Standard input and output of the talk2scope program are piped through that socket both ways. 
We can now send commands to the raspi from any other computer within network reach by starting
<pre>     netcat 192.168.2.147 8000
</pre>
on the remote computer where 192.168.2.147 is the IP number of the Raspberry Pi. In my case the 
remote computer is a Linux PC running OpenSuSe 13.1 and the netcat binary is called <tt>netcat.</tt> 
The <tt>talk2scope.sh</tt> standard input and output on the Raspberry Pi are directly linked to 
those on the remote computer and we can type *IDN? into the netcat program on the remote 
computer. It then returns the reply from the scope via the Raspberry Pi, to the remote computer. 
Cool, eh? On the remote computer the flavor of netcat (traditional or BSD) does not matter. It 
should even work from non-unix machines, which I have not tried, though. 
<p>
The only inconvenience now is that the program only works until the connection is closed. In order to
reopen it we had to log on to the Raspberry Pi and restart the nc.traditional program. However, this
we can do automatically by wrapping the program into an indefinitely running loop in the following
way
</p><pre>      while true; do nc.traditional -l -p 8000 -c /home/pi/usbtmc/talk2scope.sh ; done
</pre>
which implicitly assumes we're using the bash shell. The "while true; do done" construction makes
sure the program starts again, once it terminates. A real work saver. In order to start the 
usbtmc server gateway on the Raspberry Pi automatically I add the above line to the /etc/rc.local
system startup file. there i need to specify the absolute path to the binary, such that the 
last few lines in the rc.local file now look like
<pre>      echo "Starting USBTMC server on port 8000 and 8001"
      insmod /home/pi/usbtmc/usbtmc.ko
      while true; do nc.traditional -l -p 8000 -c /home/pi/usbtmc/talk2scope.sh ; done &amp;
      while true; do nc.traditional -l -p 8001 -c "/home/pi/usbtmc/talk2scope.sh /dev/usbtmc1" ; done &amp;
</pre>
where I also added a second copy of the line to start a second server to listen on port 8001 which 
makes a second device (a second scope, function generator, spectrum analyzer) available via
Ethernet on port 8001. The new B+ Raspberry Pi has four USB ports, so you could service up to four 
devices simultaneously without extra hardware. Note also that the command must be terminated by an 
ampersand to avoid blocking the execution of the startup process.
<p>
At the remote computer we can now talk to the oscilloscope connected to the Raspberry Pi by entering
</p><pre>      echo "*IDN?" | netcat 192.168.2.147 8000
</pre>
and receive the reply on the command line. This is great for shell scripts, but a bit inconvenient
to use from other programming languages. This can be easily remedied by the
following script called <tt>make_pipes.sh</tt>
<pre>    #!/bin/bash
    if [ ! -e /tmp/pipe_in ];  then mkfifo /tmp/pipe_in  ; fi
    if [ ! -e /tmp/pipe_out ]; then mkfifo /tmp/pipe_out ; fi
    while true ; do netcat 192.168.2.147 8000 &lt; /tmp/pipe_in &gt; /tmp/pipe_out ; done &amp;
</pre>
where we first create two FIFOs (unless they do not already exist) and use them to communicate with 
the netcat program. You may need to adapt the IP number and port number to your setup.
All we have to do on the remote computer in any other program using whatever 
programming language you prefer, is opening the file <tt>/tmp/pipe_in</tt> for writing and write 
the SCPI commands to it and open <tt>/tmp/pipe_out</tt> for reading to receive the reply from the 
oscilloscope. On the command line we write <tt>echo "*IDN?" &gt; /tmp/pipe_in</tt> and receive the 
reply via <tt>cat /tmp/pipe_out</tt> or <tt>tail -f /tmp/pipe_out</tt>. 
<p>
The server worked quite nicely and even transferring large waveforms worked all right. The 
time to transfer a 1 megabyte waveform to a remote computer takes the same time as a locally
acquired waveform. Thus we have no performance penalty for the network access, even using a
simple script based solution. 

</p><h3>Using it </h3>

This section is very specific to my Rigol oscilloscope. You need to check the "Programming 
Manual" of your own device about what SCPI commands it supports. Here I just want to give
an idea of what you can do. 
<p>
As mentioned before, the simplest way we can access the oscilloscope from the remote computer 
is by executing either of the two ways
</p><pre>      echo "*IDN?" | netcat 192.168.2.147 8000
      echo "*IDN?" &gt; /tmp/pipe_in ; cat /tmp/pipe_out
</pre>
where the second method works if the FIFOs are in place and the netcat construction at the end
of the previous section is running on the remote computer. If you want to send many commands in 
sequence, use either way
<pre>      cat commands.scpi | netcat 192.168.2.147 8000
</pre>
where the file <tt>commands.scpi</tt> contains the SCPI commands, one per line. The output 
is returned via standard output. This is convenient to set the oscilloscope into a standard
configuration, such as setting the vertical and horizontal scale and offset, as well a input
coupling. You need to consult the "Programming Manual" about details of the supported SCPI 
commands for your particular oscilloscope. Here is just an example of the contents of such
a setup file you might call <tt>setup.scpi</tt>
<pre>      :TIM:SCAL 0.0005
      :TIM:OFFS 0.001
      :CHAN1:SCAL 0.5
      :CHAN1:OFFS -1.5
      :CHAN1:COUP DC
      :CHAN2:SCAL 1
      :CHAN2:OFFS 0.0
      :CHAN1:COUP DC
      :KEY:FORC
</pre>
SCPI commands are fairly standardized, such that the above set should work with most oscilloscopes
that support SCPI commands. The last command might be specific to my Rigol scope and returns control
back to the buttons on the scope itself, rather than keeping them attached to the remote controller.
<p>
Another useful feature is reading derived, measured quantities from the scope, such as the frequency
of the signal, the peak-to-peak value, or the rise time. This is accomplished by the following SCPI 
commands, placed one command at  a time in a file that I named "meas.scpi"
</p><pre>      :MEAS:FREQ? CHAN1
      :MEAS:VPP? CHAN1
      :MEAS:RIS? CHAN1
</pre>
Executing the commands you run the following command
<pre>      cat meas.scpi &gt; /tmp/pipe_in ; cat /tmp/pipe_out
</pre>
and the three values for the currently displayed waveform are returned to standard output on
the terminal you type the previous command in. Refer to the programming manual for many more
things to measure.

<h3>Waveforms</h3>

The oscilloscope can also provide waveforms, the traces that you see on the scope's screen. For my
scope there are different options for the length of the data, either 600 points, which is one
screen full, or up to 1 million points, which allows to see both the long time scales (milli seconds)
and very fast details on the nanosecond time scale. The different option are explained in the document
"DS1000E_D Remote Data TX Commands.pdf" that is available from the Rigol web site. In continuously 
running mode, that is when the "Run" button on the scope lights green, the traces are 600 points 
long, come in binary form, and are preceeded by a 10 byte preamble describing the length of the
waveform data. The waveform is transferred to the remote computer by the SCPI command
<pre>     :WAV:DATA? CHAN1
</pre>
but since the data comes in binary form we need the scale and offset, both for the vertical and
the horizontal axis with the following SCPI commands  that I put in a file named <tt>settings.scpi</tt>
<pre>     :TIM:SCAL?
     :TIM:OFFS?
     :CHAN1:SCAL?
     :CHAN1:OFFS?
     :CHAN2:SCAL?
     :CHAN2:OFFS?
     :ACQ:SAMP?
</pre>
and run either 
<pre>     netcat 192.168.2.147 8000 &lt; settings.scpi &gt; settings.txt
</pre>
or use the FIFOs with
<pre>     cat settings.scpi &gt; /tmp/pipe_in ; cat /tmp/pipe_out &gt; settings.txt
</pre>
to create a file <tt>settings.txt</tt> with the current scope settings needed in order to be able
to convert the raw binary data from the scope using the conversion formulas found in the document 
"DS1000E_D Data Format.pdf" from the Rigol web site to obtain the time in seconds and the vertical 
scale in volts. I attach a small C-program <tt>rigol_waveform.c</tt> in which the conversion 
formulae are implemented. The program works both for 600 point waveforms and for the large
waveforms with over a million points.
<p>
In order to obtain a table of values of time and voltage of Channel 1 I first generate the 
settings.txt file from above and then run
</p><pre>        echo ":WAV:DATA? CHAN1" &gt; /tmp/pipe_in 
	./rigol_waveform &lt; /tmp/pipe_out &gt; data.ascii
</pre>
which produces a file <tt>data.ascii</tt> with two columns, one for time in seconds and the
second for the voltage in Volts. This file you can process further in any which way you desire.
If I want to see the waveform using the <tt>xmgrace</tt> program I replace the second line by
<pre>       ./rigol_waveform &lt; /tmp/pipe_out | xmgrace -pipe
</pre>
which opens a window and displays the waveform. Substitute any other program of your choice.
<p>
In order to view the million point waveforms I need to set up the oscilloscope in a special
way, which I do by preparing a file <tt>long.scpi</tt> containing the following SCPI commands
</p><pre>      :ACQ:MEMD LONG
      :WAV:POIN:MODE MAX
      :STOP
      :WAV:DATA? CHAN1
</pre>
which sets up the internal memory size usage to the maximum value, stops the acquisition, which
is needed according to the documents mentioned above and then requests the waveform data. Displaying
the long waveform using the <tt>xmgrace</tt> program I run
<pre>      cat long.scpi &gt; /tmp/pipe_in 
      ./rigol_waveform &lt; /tmp/pipe_out | xmgrace -pipe
</pre>
which will result in display of a million points and allows zooming into minute details of the
waveform, while still being able to see the variations on a long time scale.

<h3>Closing</h3>

That's it for now folks. My focus was on ad-hoc networking using netcat, which is a quick-and-dirty
way to avoid network programming using sockets and remote procedure calls, and still achieving
reasonably convenient access to a remote device via Ethernet. All we had to do is sticking to
the old UNIX paradigm of piping standard input to standard output and extending these pipes across
the network with netcat. 
<p>
All scripts and source code to the programs mentioned in this article can be downloaded from
<a href="http://ziemann.web.cern.ch/ziemann/gadget/usbtmc/usbtmc.tar.gz">here</a>. I assume that you unpack the archive in the home directory of
the default user <tt>pi</tt> om Raspberry Pi. It unpacks into two subdirectories, one called 
<tt>usbtmc</tt> that contains the things that run on the raspberry pi and a second one called
<tt>remote</tt> that contains the programs and scpi commands that execute on the remote computer
which can be, of course, a second Raspberry Pi. 
</p><p>
Needless to say, there are many great sources on the web that discuss interfacing usbtmc devices.
Particularly useful I found the following two references by
