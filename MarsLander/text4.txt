The Lander in flight

The Lander requires one more script block, to control the flight of the Lander and to check to see if it has crashed or landed.  The script on the left performs this functionality.

When the green flag is pressed, the Lander is reset to point straight upwards, the engines are turned off and its position is chosen at random along the top of the screen.  The local variables for the x and y velocity components and the flight status are also reset.  The main repeat until loop continues to run until the flying status has been reset to zero.  The first step within the loop is to reduce the vertical velocity component by a small amount.  This reduction of velocity is present to simulate the effect of gravity on the Lander. The next block within the loop checks to see if the Lander has touched the surrounding ground.  If it has touched it, then the costume is changed to the crashed version and the flying status is set to zero.  If it has not touched the surrounding ground, then the program checks to see if the landing feet have touched the landing pad or not.  If they have touched the landing pad, then the vertical velocity component and the direction of the Lander is checked.  If the touch down is not successful, the Lander will be shown as crashed.  If the landing is successful, then the Lander will say "Landed!".  While the Lander is not in contact with the ground, the position of the Lander is updated using the velocity components.  In this program, the speed of the loop regulates how fast time is passing in the simulation.

To make the game harder or easier, try changing the reduction of the vertical velocity in the loop (the effect of gravity) or try changing the effect of the thrusters.  The lander could be given a limited amount of fuel, by counting the number of times the space bar is pressed.
