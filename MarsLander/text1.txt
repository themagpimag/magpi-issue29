Adding natural physics processes to games can make them more real and thrilling to play.  In Issue 17, a simple projectile motion game was introduced.  The game included  gravity and initial velocity.  These concepts can be used for other types of games too.

This month's game introduces the simulation of a spaceship landing on a remote planet, where the landing craft obeys the normal laws of physics.  In this case, the Lander has rocket motors to change its direction.
