The Stage

Two backgrounds were created for the Stage, where the size of the landing pad and the amount of surrounding red rock was chosen to be different.  Once the background images had been drawn, the Lander sprite was resized to match landing pad by the right clicking the mouse on the Lander sprite.  The colours used for the surrounding ground and the landing pad for the two backgrounds were chosen to be the same, to allow tests based on the colours of the sprite and the background.  Then a simple script was written to select a random Stage background when the green flag is pressed.
 

Controlling the Lander

The Lander is controlled with the left and right arrow keys and the space bar.  To prevent the controls from moving the lander when the game is not taking place, a local variable was created called flying.  If the flying variable is set to one, then the controls will change the angle of the Lander sprite.

Tapping on the left arrow causes the Lander to turn 15 degrees to the left and tapping on the right arrow causes the lander to turn 15 degrees to the right.

The space bar is used to fire the thrusters, to slow down the Lander and manoeurve it to the landing pad.  When the space bar is pressed, the costume of the Lander changes to the version that shows the engines burning.  The costume continues to show the engines burning, while the space bar is pressed.  When the space bar is released, the costume changes back to show the engines as being off.

While the space bar is pressed the velocity of the Lander is increased, according to its current direction.  The sine and cosine operators are used to calculate the increase of the x and y velocity components using the direction, where the velocity components are stored in local variables vx and vy respectively.   The direction is zero, when the Lander points straight upwards, 180 when it points straight downwards, positive when it points to the right and negative when it points to the left.
